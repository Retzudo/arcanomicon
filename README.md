Arcanomicon
===========

[Arcanomicon](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Arcanomicon) is supposed to be
a replacement for popular but overloaded WoW interface websites such as
[wow.curse.com](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow) or the venerable
[wowinterface.com](http://www.wowinterface.com/addons.php). Arcanomicon
will be entirely open source and solely focused on WoW interface add-ons
and nothing else.

There will be a public API and an open source desktop client for
synchronizing add-ons.
